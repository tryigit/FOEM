## 📌 Overview

**FOEM** is an advanced, specialized application designed to systematically bypass and remove manufacturer-imposed restrictions on mobile devices, such as Bootloader (BL) locks. Developed strictly for **freedom of software** and **academic research**, FOEM grants users complete control over their hardware. 

We believe that once you purchase a device, you should have full authority over its operation. FOEM is built to break down artificial barriers safely and efficiently.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Bootloader (BL) Unlocking:** Seamlessly circumvent BL locks to allow custom firmware installation, root access, and low-level system modifications.
- **Advanced Boot Unlock Features:** Comprehensive options for unlocking bootloaders across various manufacturers, completely free of charge.
- **ADB & Fastboot Support:** Full integration with ADB and Fastboot for complete device management, debugging, and flashing capabilities.
- **EDL (Emergency Download) Support:** Low-level device flashing and unbricking through emergency protocols like Qualcomm's EDL mode.
- **Repair Shop Utilities:** Integrates essential applications and tools commonly used by professional phone repair shops to diagnose, service, and restore devices.
- **Advanced Diagnostic Capabilities:** Deep-level insights into your device's partitions, boot states, and OEM parameters.
- **Academic & Research Focused:** An essential tool for security researchers, developers, and academics analyzing mobile operating systems and bootchains.
- **100% Free:** FOEM is provided completely free of charge. No premium tiers, no hidden fees, just unrestricted freedom.

## 🎯 Our Mission

**We will prevent phone repair shops from charging fees for software through dealerships. This is a free app.** FOEM is designed to give you back control of your device without hidden costs or gatekeeping.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The user interface and user experience of FOEM are deeply inspired by the sleek, intuitive, and modern designs of **iOS** and **NothingOS**. We believe that powerful tools should also be beautiful and easy to use.
